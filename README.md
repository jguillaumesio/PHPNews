# PHPNews
Include a news system to your website easily\
You need atleast PHP v5.5.0

##INSTALLATION  
1. Create a database  
2. Put the news folder at the root of your website  
3. Now you just have to go to the link of your website and add /news (http://example.com/news) and follow instructions  
4. Create article.php page at the root of your website (it would be the fullwidth viewer for news)

At the beginning of each files where you will include something from PHPNews you need to add this:
```
<?php
session_start();
include("news/connexiondb.php");
$ini_array = parse_ini_file("news/admin/config.ini");
?>
```
To include inscription/connexion
```
<?php
	if(isset($_GET['inscription'])){
		include("news/espace_membre/inscription.php");
	}
	elseif(isset($_SESSION['statut'])){
		if($_SESSION['rang']>=1){
			echo "<a href='news/admin'>Administration</a><br>";
		}
	echo "<a href='news/espace_membre/deconnexion.php'>DÃ©connexion</a>";
	}
